This is the homework assignment as developed and eventually completed by Storm Holloway and Charissa Smith.

We chose to model a restaurant. The three specific elements we focussed on are the Waiter, the Chef and the Customer.

The first object we modeled is the Waiter.

At some point we will look at the interactions between the three, but that is currently beyond our level of understanding.

Some things to note:
To get minitest to be available to the step definitions we had to:
- create a support directory under features
- add an env.rb file to the support directory with these lines
	require 'minitest/autorun'
	World(MiniTest::Assertions)
	
To have cucumber find the .rb files in lib, we had to:
- create a loader.rb file in lib with these lines:
	ROOT= File.expand_path './'
	require File.join ROOT, 'lib', 'xxxx.rb', xxxx is the .rb file to require, can later make this all .rb files in lib except loader.rb
- add this line to env.rb
	require File.join "./" ,"lib" ,"loader.rb"
	
	
Here is the gist of what we have modelled (result of running lib/restaurant_app.rb). If you try to run it yourself you will likely get a different
result. Be careful because the 'require' assumes you are in the lib/ directory when you run it. I still haven't figured out the best way to make these 
references...

Welcome to SandC's Fine New Restaurant.
We have an extensive menu, although we only serve foods that start with the letter P.

pizza             $10.49
pasta             $ 8.86
porkjowl          $13.00
persimmons        $ 6.00
potatosalad       $ 7.50
plankton          $ 5.00
parsley           $ 0.50


Currently we only have one waiter whose name is Bob. We tried to hire someone named Paul
to fit with our P-themed restaurant, but we were concerned that Bob may bring suit as
he was clearly the better candidate. 

Bob's only weakness is that he is a bit volitile -- in fact perhaps a bit manic depressive.
When he greets a customer he says something different depending on his current mood -- which 
changes on a dime. For example, here is what he said to the last 10 customers:

        Hello, My name is Bob. How can I serve you today?
        Sup? What can I get for your supper?
        Wadda you want?
        Sup? What can I get for your supper?
        Wadda you want?
        Chill. I will be back soon to take your order.
        Chill. I will be back soon to take your order.
        Chill. I will be back soon to take your order.
        Wadda you want?
        Hello, My name is Bob. How can I serve you today?
        Chill. I will be back soon to take your order.

But Bob is not the only moody one. Each customer when they enter the restaurant comes in
bearing the goodness or badness of their day. Today we have 4 customers and here are their
moods:
          happy
          very happy
          happy
          indifferent

Hopefully their experience in our restaurant will positively alter their mood, cause them to
leave a good tip and to come back later with all of their friends. Unfortunatly with Bob's
volatility, we cant be so confident of that result. Lets take a look at our first customer's
experience:

  He comes in feeling happy
  Bob greets him with: Wadda you want?
  After this his mood is indifferent.  Our customer orders a few things from the menu.
  He is hoping to enjoy  pizza, plankton, potatosalad.
  After enjoying his fine meal, he gets the check and calculates a tip.
  His meal costs $22.99 and he decides to leave a tip of 10%
  He leaves the restaurant with the following thought- I'm never coming here again
