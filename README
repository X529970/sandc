This is the homework assignment as developed and eventually completed by Storm Holloway and Charissa Smith.

We chose to model a restaurant. The three specific elements we focussed on are the Waiter, the Chef and the Customer.

The first object we modeled is the Waiter.

At some point we will look at the interactions between the three, but that is currently beyond our level of understanding.
