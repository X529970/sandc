This is the homework assignment as developed and eventually completed by Storm Holloway and Charissa Smith.

We chose to model a restaurant. The three specific elements we focussed on are the Waiter, the Chef and the Customer.

The first object we modeled is the Waiter.

At some point we will look at the interactions between the three, but that is currently beyond our level of understanding.

Some things to note:
To get minitest to be available to the step definitions we had to:
- create a support directory under features
- add an env.rb file to the support directory with these lines
	require 'minitest/autorun'
	World(MiniTest::Assertions)
	
To have cucumber find the .rb files in lib, we had to:
- create a loader.rb file in lib with these lines:
	ROOT= File.expand_path './'
	require File.join ROOT, 'lib', 'xxxx.rb', xxxx is the .rb file to require, can later make this all .rb files in lib except loader.rb
- add this line to env.rb
	require File.join "./" ,"lib" ,"loader.rb"
